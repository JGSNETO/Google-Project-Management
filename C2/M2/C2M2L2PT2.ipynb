    "# Gathering information to define scope\n",
    "In this lesson, you are learning to define project scope status and differentiate in-scope, out-of-scope, and scope creep factors that affect reaching the project goal. Let’s focus here on how to identify vital elements of a project’s scope and examine the right questions to ask in order to define it. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Asking scope-defining questions\n",
    "Imagine that while working in a restaurant management group, your manager calls and asks you to “update the dining space,” then quickly hangs up the phone without providing further instruction. In this initial handoff from the manager, you are missing a lot of information. How do you even know what to ask?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s quickly recap the concept of scope. The scope provides the boundaries for your project. You define the scope to help identify necessary resources, resource costs, and a schedule for the project. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the situation we just described, here are some questions you might ask your manager in order to get the information you need to define the scope of the project:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Stakeholders\n",
    "- How did you arrive at the decision to update the dining space? \n",
    "- Did the request originate from the restaurant owner, customers, or other stakeholders? \n",
    "- Who will approve the scope for the project? \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Goals\n",
    "- What is the reason for updating the dining space? \n",
    "- What isn't working in the current dining space? \n",
    "- What is the end goal of this project? \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Deliverables\n",
    "- Which dining space is being updated? \n",
    "- What exactly needs to be updated? \n",
    "- Does the dining space need a remodel? \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Resources\n",
    "- What materials, equipment, and people will be needed? \n",
    "- Will we need to hire contractors? \n",
    "- Will we need to attain a floor plan and building permits? \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Budget\n",
    "- What is the budget for this project? Is it fixed or flexible? \n",
    "\n",
    "6. Schedule\n",
    "- How much time do we have to complete the project? \n",
    "- When does the project need to be completed? \n",
    "\n",
    "7. Flexibility\n",
    "- How much flexibility is there? \n",
    "- What is the highest priority: hitting the deadline, sticking to the budget, or making sure the result meets all the quality targets? \n",
    "\n",
    "## Key takeaway\n",
    "Taking the time to ask questions and ensure that you understand the scope of the project will help reduce expenses, rework, frustration, and confusion. Make sure you understand the who, what, when, where, why, and how as it applies to the scope. If you are missing any of that information, focus your questions on those elements. The initiation phase of the project sets the foundation for the project, so ensuring that you understand the scope and expectations during this stage is essential. "

    "# Strategies for controlling scope creep\n",
    "In this lesson, we have discussed the importance of defining and documenting a project’s scope and how to identify scope creep factors that can affect reaching a project’s goal. In this reading, we will focus on how to control scope creep.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scope management best practices\n",
    "The scope of a project can get out of control quickly—so quickly that you may not even notice it. Scope creep is when a project’s work starts to grow beyond what was originally agreed upon during the initiation phase. Scope creep can put stress on you, your team, and your organization, and it can put your project at risk. The effects of scope creep can hinder every aspect of the project, from the schedule to the budget to the resources, and ultimately, its overall success. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some best practices for scope management and controlling scope creep: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define your project’s requirements. Communicate with your stakeholders or customers to find out exactly what they want from the project and document those requirements during the initiation phase. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Set a clear project schedule. Time and task management are essential for sticking to your project’s scope. Your schedule should outline all of your project’s requirements and the tasks that are necessary to achieve them.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Determine what is out of scope. Make sure your stakeholders, customers, and project team understand when proposed changes are out of scope. Come to a clear agreement about the potential impacts to the project and document your agreement. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Provide alternatives. Suggest alternative solutions to your customer or stakeholder. You can also help them consider how their proposed changes might create additional risks. Perform a cost-benefit analysis, if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Set up a change control process. During the course of your project, some changes are inevitable. Determine the process for how each change will be defined, reviewed, and approved (or rejected) before you add it to your project plan. Make sure your project team is aware of this process.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Learn how to say no. Sometimes you will have to say no to proposed changes. Saying no to a key stakeholder or customer can be uncomfortable, but it can be necessary to protect your project’s scope and its overall quality. If you are asked to take on additional tasks, explain how they will interfere with the budget, timeline, and/or resources defined in your initial project requirements. \n",
    "\n",
    "7. Collect costs for out-of-scope work. If out-of-scope work is required, be sure to document all costs incurred. That includes costs for work indirectly impacted by the increased scope. Be sure to indicate what the charges are for. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Key takeaway\n",
    "You can only avoid scope creep if everyone involved in the project understands and agrees on responsibilities, boundaries, and timelines. Avoiding scope creep also requires clear communication, expectation management, and a well-defined path to your desired outcome. Following the strategies discussed here can help you proactively manage scope creep before it creeps into your project! "

    "# Triple Constraint: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The Triple Constraint: In project management, time (the schedule and timeline), cost (the budget that determines what resources can be used), and scope (the deliverables and activities) make up the triple constraint.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The Fast, Cheap, Good Dilemma: Projects have to choose between speed, cost, and quality, and you can't have all three simultaneously. Adjustments to scope, time, or cost affect the other two, which in turn affects project outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Triangle Teaches Trade-offs: The project management triangle provides you with a convenient way to explain the interdependence of scope, time, and cost and the necessary trade-offs to clients."
