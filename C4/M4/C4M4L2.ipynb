    "# Providing “air cover” to your team\n",
    "As you have learned so far, project managers build teams that meet project goals in many different ways, from delegating responsibility and prioritizing tasks to promoting trust and psychological safety. \n",
    "\n",
    "But there is another skill great project managers have that we will cover in this reading: the ability to provide air cover to protect their team. Air cover refers to support for and protection of a team in the face of out-of-scope requests or criticism from leadership. \n",
    "\n",
    "## What is air cover?\n",
    "A lot of what we have covered throughout this program has focused on leading and managing a project team. Much of project management involves overseeing the work of others, but it also involves managing the needs and expectations of those above you. Those people are your stakeholders, project sponsors, and other leaders within your organization. \n",
    "\n",
    "Though the needs and requests of your stakeholders are crucial to the project’s success, there may come a time when you will need to prioritize the needs of your team over the wants of your stakeholders. This is called providing “air cover” for your team, and it is an important part of managing a project. The ability to effectively provide air cover requires a trusting relationship between a project manager and their stakeholders. In this relationship, the project manager aims to demonstrate their abilities to lead a team and communicate effectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is some risk involved in providing air cover. Sometimes a project manager provides air cover and the project team is still unable to deliver on the goals of the project. In this case, stakeholders may question the project manager’s ability to complete projects successfully. So, when preparing to defend your team against out-of-scope requests, be sure that you are confident in your team’s progress toward the project goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Providing air cover: A case study\n",
    "Imagine, for example, that you are a project manager for a brand of coffee sold in supermarkets throughout your region. You and your team have been tasked with launching three new flavors of ground coffee: vanilla, hazelnut, and mocha. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, well into the execution phase, your project sponsor sets a meeting with you to make an out-of-scope request: They would like to add a caramel-flavored coffee to the product lineup. Your team is already at maximum capacity preparing to launch the agreed-upon flavors, and a fourth flavor would add an unreasonable amount of work and stress to your very busy team.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s discuss how you might provide air cover for your team in a situation like this one.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Saying “No” without explicitly saying “No”\n",
    "One way to provide air cover to your team is to say “no” to your sponsor’s request without explicitly saying “no.” \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few ways to do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can gently push back with a polite explanation that their request won’t be possible to complete under the current constraints—the scope, time, and/or cost—of the project. \n",
    "\n",
    "- You can politely offer to get back to the stakeholder with your response. This gives you time to better understand the request and to consult with trusted team members to lay out the benefits and costs of this request. And, if you are lucky, this might even give the stakeholder the opportunity to reconsider their request or forget about it entirely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether you choose to push back immediately or get back to your stakeholder with your response, it is crucial to offer alternative solutions. Maybe the project timeline can expand to accommodate the request. Or maybe you and your team have a strong relationship with another team at the organization that can help fulfill  the request. Whatever the alternative, brainstorming other options can help soften the blow and provide stakeholders with new ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you consider telling your sponsor that the current project timeline will only allow for the launch of three new coffee flavors, and that the launch of a fourth flavor would only be possible by pushing the launch date back by two months. If you were to respond to your sponsor in this way, you would be both gently refusing their request and offering them an alternative that could work for your team.\n",
    "\n",
    "While a simple “no” response might frustrate the person making the request, gentle pushback paired with alternative options can protect your team from new work while preserving your professional relationship with stakeholders. If your stakeholders trust your leadership abilities and perspective, then they will be more likely to accept your pushback and alternative solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Intervening from behind the scenes\n",
    "Another way project managers provide air cover for their teams is to master the challenge of  delicately intervening from behind the scenes when a stakeholder is making unrealistic requests or offering unreasonable critiques. \n",
    "\n",
    "Continuing with our coffee company example, you know how hard your team has been working to launch the new products. To avoid causing the extra stress that might come with the knowledge that the stakeholder wants to increase their workload, you avoid sharing this request with your entire project team.\n",
    "\n",
    "This doesn’t mean you need to come up with a solution all by yourself, however. Instead of calling a team meeting to discuss the stakeholder’s request for a new flavor, you consult with only two trusted members of your team to help brainstorm solutions. One of these team members mentions that they know two new flavors are slated to be added to the fall product lineup in six months, and that perhaps the caramel flavor could be launched then instead of with the current group. This would give your team more time to work on developing the product while still fulfilling the stakeholder’s request. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, you bring the suggestions of adding the flavor to the fall product lineup or pushing back the launch date of the current lineup to the project sponsor, and they accept your solution to launch the new flavor in the fall.\n",
    "\n",
    "Managing the expectations of your stakeholder while looping in relevant teammates on a need-to-know basis was essential here. This allowed your team to focus on their work without the possibility of an increased workload or an unnecessary distraction."

    "# A framework for ethical decision-making\n",
    "Ethical leadership is a form of leadership that promotes and values honesty, justice, respect, community, and integrity. As the leader of a project team, you will be expected to help your team succeed by leading with ethics. Building respect and trust with the teams you work with—from individuals to external partners to project stakeholders—begins with practicing ethical conduct. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this reading, you’ll gain an understanding of a common framework for ethical decision-making that can help you ensure your actions align with the ethical standards of your organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ethics within your organization\n",
    "Ethics can be defined as the principles of conduct governing an individual or a group. However, there is no single, universally-accepted grouping of ethical standards—these definitions differ based on the culture and community at your company. In the working world, ethical standards may differ based on profession, industry, and organization. Usually, an organization will have its own code of conduct which specifies the standards to which it holds its employees accountable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here at Google, our code of conduct makes clear the expectations that we have for our employees and board members. It is possible that the organizations you will join throughout your career will have codes of conduct, too.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Part of the challenge of leading with ethics is ensuring that your actions align with the ethical standards of your community, both within your organization and beyond it. In your role as a project manager, a clear framework for ethical decision-making can help guide you to make positive decisions throughout your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A common framework for ethical decision-making\n",
    "The Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University developed the following framework as a helpful guide for ethical decision-making. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Recognize an ethical issue\n",
    "According to this framework, you can begin to question the ethics of an issue by asking yourself questions about the nature of the issue. Could your decision negatively impact another person or group of people? Does the issue go beyond what is legal or efficient? From there, you can proceed onto fact gathering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: A vendor you have worked with in the past sends you a generous holiday gift shortly before you are about to select a vendor for a particular task in your project. If you accept the gift, would others be negatively impacted? To determine the answer to this question, get more facts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Get the facts\n",
    "Decide what you should do about the issue, and seek answers as needed. Consult with the right people to consider all of the options available to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Continuing with the example above, you should check to see if your company has ethics guidelines regarding accepting gifts from external parties. If not, consult with your HR representative about the matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluate alternative actions\n",
    "You can evaluate alternative actions by asking yourself the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- “Which option will produce the most good and do the least harm?”\n",
    "\n",
    "- “Which option best respects the rights of all who have a stake?” \n",
    "\n",
    "- “Which option treats people equally or proportionally?”\n",
    "\n",
    "- “Which option best serves the community as a whole, not just some members?”\n",
    "\n",
    "- “Which option leads me to act as the sort of person I want to be?”\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that your answers to these questions are subjective, and you may want to elicit the opinion of others before deciding on an alternative action.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: In the case of the vendor gift example, the answer to the question “Which option treats people equally or proportionally?” might be “decline the gift,” given that accepting it might influence your decision about who to award the contract to.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Make a decision and test it\n",
    "Once you have chosen an option, test it by imagining the reaction to your choice from a person whose opinion you value. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Example: Once you have decided to decline the gift, discuss your decision with your manager, HR representative, or a trusted colleague.\n",
    "\n",
    "Act and reflect on the outcome\n",
    "Consider how to carry out your decision with thoughtfulness and care, and after you act, consider the results of your decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example: Respectfully decline the vendor’s gift, noting your reason (for example, your company’s ethical guidelines state that employees are not permitted to accept gifts valued at more than $20 from vendors or contractors).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key takeaway \n",
    "A framework like this one can help you feel better-equipped to make ethical decisions regarding your project and team, which is a central component of ethical leadership.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like so much of project management, ethical leadership takes diligence and practice, and it is crucial to build this skill. As you become more comfortable leading project teams, you will strengthen your ability to make decisions that you can feel good about. Gaining trust and respect from the people you work with can make it easier to influence without authority. If those around you trust your decision-making, they may be more likely to try to help you achieve project goals, even if you aren’t their direct manager. "
