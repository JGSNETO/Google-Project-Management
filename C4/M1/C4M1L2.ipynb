    "# Choose the right tracking method for your project\n",
    "So far, you've learned about the importance of tracking project progress. You’ve also reviewed some of the different tracking methods used by project managers, like project plans, Gantt and Burndown charts, and Roadmaps. This reading will explore and compare these popular tracking methods in more detail so you can feel more confident choosing the best method for your projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gantt charts\n",
    "The Gantt chart is one of the most popular tracking methods and can be used for all types of projects. Gantt charts typically live in your project plan and are updated as the project progresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gantt charts are useful for:\n",
    "\n",
    "Helping a team stay on schedule\n",
    "\n",
    "Projects with lots of tasks, dependencies, and milestones\n",
    "\n",
    "Projects with large teams, because ownership and responsibilities are explicitly laid out visually\n",
    "\n",
    "Asana, one of the work management software tools featured in this certification, has useful resources for getting started with Gantt charts. Practice working with Gantt charts on your own with a free Asana trial or by downloading a free Gantt chart template from Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Roadmaps\n",
    "Roadmaps are another common tracking method. Like Gantt charts, Roadmaps also track both individual and project progress toward milestones. However, Roadmaps are best suited for tracking big milestones in your project. \n",
    "\n",
    "Roadmaps are useful for:\n",
    "\n",
    "High-level tracking of large milestones. Roadmaps outline the project as a whole and provide an overall snapshot of key points—just like an actual roadmap contains points of interest and mile markers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Illustrating to your team or key stakeholders how a project should evolve over time\n",
    "\n",
    "Roadmaps can be built using different tools. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Burndown charts\n",
    "Burndown charts are typically used by Agile Scrum teams. Burndown charts reveal how quickly your team is working by displaying how much work is left and how much time remains to complete the work. The main uses of a Burndown chart are to keep the project team on top of targeted completion dates and make them aware of scope creep if it occurs. The chart should be displayed so everyone can see it and needs to be updated regularly in order to be effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "Burndown charts are useful for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Projects that require a detailed review of tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "- Projects where finishing on time is the top priority\n",
    "\n",
    "- A Burndown chart helps you, as a project manager, understand how your team works and what influences their ability to complete tasks on time. This way, you can address issues right away, before they become major problems. They also help you plan more efficiently for the next project by identifying potential problem areas."

    "# Project status reports\n",
    "In this lesson, you are learning to identify and compare various types of tracking methods. This reading will cover project status reports and how you can use them to track and communicate common project elements in a snapshot.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key components of a project status report\n",
    "A project status report gives an overview of all of the project’s common elements and summarizes them in a snapshot. It is an efficient communication tool to convey the latest status in one place for the team and stakeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most status reports contain the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Project name: The project name should be specific to the purpose of the project so that the overall goal of the project can be understood at-a-glance. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Date: You will create project status reports many times during the course of a project’s implementation phase. Reports can be created weekly or monthly—it all depends on the stakeholders’ needs and pace of the project. Adding the date to each status report acts as a reference point for your audience and also creates a history log of the project’s status over time. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Summary: The summary condenses the project’s goals, schedule, highlights, and lowlights in one central place for easy stakeholder visibility. Usually, the summary section will be followed by, or grouped with, the timeline summary and the overall project status.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Status: As you can imagine, status is a crucial piece. The status of the project illustrates your actual progress versus your planned progress. In project management, a common way to depict this is through RAG (red, amber, green), or Red-Yellow-Green, status reporting. RAG follows a traffic light pattern to indicate progress and status. Red indicates that there are issues that need resolution and that the project may be delayed or go significantly over budget. Amber/Yellow means that there are potential issues with schedule or budget, but that the issues can likely be resolved with corrective actions. And green means the schedule and budget are doing fine and that the project is on track. You can use RAG to indicate the overall project status, as well as milestone status. Every project team and stakeholder may have a slightly different perspective on what the colors mean and how urgent it is to escalate issues when they see an amber/yellow or red status, so it’s important to make sure everyone understands what the different color statuses mean for your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Milestones and tasks: A summary of the project’s major milestones thus far and current tasks helps the team and stakeholders easily visualize the progress of those elements. In a project plan, you will typically depict the tasks and milestones as ‘not started,’ ‘in progress’ or ‘completed’ at an item-by-item level. But, in the project status report, it is common to summarize these items into two categories to better communicate the status. You’ll use key accomplishments to detail what has happened, and upcoming to detail what big milestones you will accomplish next.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Issues: The issues include your project's current roadblocks and potential risks. Status reports are an important opportunity to set expectations with your stakeholders. If your project status is red or amber, you can flag what is preventing you from being where you planned to be. You can also use this opportunity to state your plan to get the project back to green, and ask for any resources or help you may need to do so. You will learn more about communicating big risks and issues in the upcoming videos.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project status report types \n",
    "With those key elements in mind, you can format your report in a variety of ways depending on your audience and what you need to communicate. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you need to share a status report with your team for a project that contains multiple layers of complexity, it may be best to format the report in a spreadsheet in order to keep track of all the moving parts. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you simply need to communicate updates to senior stakeholders, your status report may be best formatted as a slideshow, like the one below, containing only an overview of the most key points.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key takeaways\n",
    "To recap, project status reports are a powerful tool to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Improve and simplify communication across the team.\n",
    "- Keep everyone, including key stakeholders, informed.\n",
    "- Request more resources and support (if needed).\n",
    "- Create structure and transparency by recording the project status in a centralized place.\n",
