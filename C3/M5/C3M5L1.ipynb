    "- Are you resolving a problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "Some team members may require detailed information, while others may only need an overview of the situation. No matter your audience, you should be sure to identify the purpose of the message, state the information or request clearly and concisely, and stay on topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deliver your message\n",
    "As you craft your message, think about which methods are available and appropriate for communicating with various members of your team, whether that is in person, in a video conference, over the phone, via email, or in a meeting. Choosing the right method is especially important if you have team members or stakeholders in different regions and time zones. Also, be sure to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Avoid including any sensitive or potentially private information. \n",

    "\n",
    "## Obtain feedback and incorporate that feedback going forward\n",
    "Communication doesn’t end when you deliver your message, so be sure to follow up with your audience by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Checking to make sure your message was clear.\n",
    "- Asking them for feedback.\n",
    "- Encouraging open communication.\n",
    "- Responding to questions quickly.\n",
