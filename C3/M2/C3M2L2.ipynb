    "- Time estimation: A prediction of the total amound of time required to complete a task. \n",
    "- Effort estimation: A prediction of the amount and difficulty of active work required to complete a task. \n",
    "- Unrealistic effor estimates happen when you have understimated the amount of time it will take to complete a task. \n",
    "- Too much optimism can lead you to overlook potential risks that could set your plans behind schedule. \n",
    "- Your teammates will have the most realistic understanding of the amount of work required to complete a task, and will be able to provide you with the best estimate. \n",
    "- Sub-tasks: Smaller tasks that are required to complete a larger task. \n",
    "- Asking the teammate assigned to the task for their estimate is likely to yield a more accurate estimation. \n",
    "- Buffer: Extra time added to the end of a task of project to account for unexpected slowdowns or delays in work progress. \n",
    "- Types of scheduling buffers:\n",
    "1. Task buffers: Extra time tacked on to a specific task. It should be used primarily for tasks that are out of the project team's control. It should be used more sparingly for tasks within the team's control. Adding a buffer to every project task could lengthen your project schedule unnecessarily. \n",
    "2. Project Buffer: Extra time tacked onto the end of a project. "
