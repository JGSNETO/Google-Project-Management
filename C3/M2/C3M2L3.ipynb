    "# Creating a project plan: Tools and templates\n",
    "Project plans are critical because they are used to capture the scope and time it takes to complete a project. The project plan is essentially the project’s blueprint—it lays out all of the activities and milestones that your team needs to achieve in order to successfully complete the project. Project plans come in various shapes, sizes, and forms. Depending on the project you are managing, the template you use may vary, and some companies even have standard templates they require their project managers to use. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous videos, you learned about various tools and techniques to create a project plan. But how do you know which tools and techniques to use and when? As a general rule, it is best to use a spreadsheet for a simple project and project management software for a more complex project. Regardless of what tool you use, be sure to include this key information: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Task ID numbers or task names: You might end up with dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of tasks in a project. Assigning a task ID or name makes it easy to find and reference a task when communicating with team members and stakeholders. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Task durations: A task duration is the amount of time you estimate that task should take. Adding task durations to your project plan helps you organize and prioritize the tasks in the project to help ensure you hit your goal on time. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Start and finish dates: Including start and finish dates for each task helps you track whether you are progressing on time or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Who is responsible for what: Including each team member’s role and responsibilities helps promote clarity and efficiency. As a best practice, assign an owner to each task, as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using a spreadsheet to build a project plan\n",
    "Spreadsheets are an excellent tool to use for project plans, particularly for projects that are less complex and that have a clear assignment of tasks. Spreadsheets can require a lot of manual input of information, but as a project manager, you may find that you like the control that spreadsheets provide. Spreadsheets are also customizable, so you can tailor them to your project’s needs. \n",
    "\n",
    "The graphic below shows what a project plan for a website launch might look like in a simple spreadsheet.\n",

    "There are many work management tool options available for you to utilize when planning your project. We covered some of these in previous videos, but as a refresher, it is important to keep in mind that every company, project manager, and customer has a work management tool preference. You may come across tools like Smartsheet, Asana , Jira , Trello, and many more. These tools allow for collaboration and communication at a task level. \n"

    "# Introduction to Kanban boards\n",
    "Kanban boards are a visual tool used to manage tasks and workflows. Kanban boards can be created on whiteboards, magnetic boards, poster boards, computer programs, and more. Tasks associated with the project are written on cards. These cards are placed in columns, which represent the progress made. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although Kanban boards are useful for all kinds of projects, they are typically most suitable for project teams working in an Agile project management approach. You may remember that Agile project management is an iterative approach to managing projects that focuses on continuous releases and incorporates customer feedback with every iteration. Once you become a project manager and have created your project plan, you can decide whether a Kanban board is right for your project. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Purposes of a Kanban board\n",
    "Kanban boards are used to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Give a quick visual understanding of work details and provide critical task information.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Facilitate handoffs between stakeholders, such as between development and testing resources or between team members who work on related tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Help with capturing metrics and improving workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using a Kanban board\n",
    "Before creating a board, it is best practice to gather the necessary information and lay out key elements, such as tasks, status, dates, and durations. That information is useful when building your board. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s turn our focus to an example of a Kanban board below. Each colored rectangle is associated with a task. The tasks are represented horizontally across the effort timeline. Each column represents where the task is in relation to its completion. So as a task is started, it will move from to do, to in progress. When the project is almost ready to be released or complete, it will move to testing, and when it is tested and approved, it will move to done. Note that this is just one example of a Kanban board, and depending on the tool you use—such as software or a physical board—you can customize your board using various columns and cards. The board can also have rows for resources (team or person), to help visualize who is actively working on what.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating cards\n",
    "Cards will vary in style—you can even use sticky notes on a whiteboard—but most cards will contain a few key details about the task that they represent. When using physical cards, teams often use both sides. Here is what both sides of the card should include:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Front\n",
    "- Title and unique identifier: Make sure you have a quick reference for tasks and ID numbers.\n",
    "- Description of work: Briefly describe the task to be accomplished. Remember that this is intended to be captured on something no larger than an index card.\n",
    "- Estimation of effort: Estimate the amount of work it will take to complete the task. For example, you can write “small,” “medium,” or “large” to indicate the level of effort you think that task will involve. \n",
    "- Who is assigned to the task: Indicate who is responsible for completing the task; ideally, one person per card.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Back \n",
    "- Start date: Include the start date of the task for use in metrics, tracking, and ensuring that your time estimate is accurate.\n",
    "- Blocked days: Indicate which days your task may be halted. A task can become blocked if it can’t continue to be worked on. For example, if you were supposed to receive a deliverable and it hasn’t been delivered yet, then your day may be blocked for this particular task.\n",
    "- Finish date: As with any plan, it is important to track when the task is supposed to be finished. This allows you to ensure that your project is still on track to reach the end goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Kanban board software\n",
    "If you opt to use a software tool rather than a physical board, you have a few options. Asana and Trello are both great software tools to use if you are looking to introduce Kanban to your project. There are many options, so take the time to evaluate which is best for you and your project.\n",
