    "# How to create a fishbone diagram\n",
    "Previously, you learned about some tools to help you identify risks. In this reading, we will dive deeper into how to create and use one of those tools: the fishbone diagram.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fishbone diagrams—also known as Ishikawa diagrams or cause-and-effect diagrams—were developed by Japanese organizational theorist Kaoru Ishikawa in the 1960s to measure quality control processes in the shipbuilding industry. Fishbone diagrams are a visual way to look at cause and effect. They are called fishbone diagrams because they have a similar shape to a fish skeleton. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fishbone diagrams help the team to brainstorm potential causes of a problem or risk and sort them into useful categories. These categories show the areas that you should focus on to mitigate that risk. Fishbone diagrams are also very helpful in finding the root cause of a problem. A root cause is the initial cause of a situation that introduces a problem or risk. The purpose of using fishbone diagrams in risk management is to identify the root cause of a potential problem for a project or program.  \n",

    "## Case study: Using a fishbone diagram to identify causes of risks  \n",
    "\n",
    "Miguel is a project manager at Office Supply Inc. He is in the planning phase for an upcoming summer promotion project, which will include free delivery of products. Unfortunately, in the past, the company has had trouble delivering its products to downtown office buildings on time. Miguel builds a fishbone diagram to see if he can identify some of the possible causes of this problem in order to mitigate this risk on the current project. He follows these steps to build his diagram:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Step 1) Define the problem \n",
    "First, Miguel clearly defines what the problem entails. In this case, Miguel states the problem as “trouble delivering products to downtown office buildings on time.” Then he adds the problem to the head of his fishbone diagram. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Step 2) Identify the categories \n",
    "In this step, Miguel thinks of the types of categories that could be causing the problem. These categories will change depending on the type of problem or industry. Some common examples of categories include “people,” “technology,” “materials,” “transportation,” “money,” “time,” “environment,” and “procedures.” \n",
    "\n",
    "For the delivery problem at Office Supply Inc., Miguel lists the categories “people,” “technology,” “materials,” “transportation,” and “environment” at the top and bottom of the lists to the left of the problem in his fishbone diagram. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Step 3) Brainstorm the causes \n",
    "Now that Miguel has identified possible categories that relate to the risk, he brainstorms areas of concern within each category. He reaches out to his team for help in identifying these possible causes. Then, Miguel fills in the lists with some of the causes that could be related to each category.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pro tip: Brainstorming should be a judgment-free zone. Encourage the flow of information related to the categories and try not to rule things out. When dealing with human factors, steer clear of naming individuals; instead, focus solely on behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Step 4) Analyze the causes\n",
    "Now that Miguel has discovered several possible causes for the delivery problems to downtown offices, he analyzes those causes. He needs to identify the root cause of the existing problem so he can figure out how to mitigate it for the current project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that one cause of a problem isn’t necessarily the root cause. For example, Miguel has identified that a lack of forklifts is a problem. Having more forklifts would allow the company to get the products on and off of the trucks more quickly. However, after calculating the amount of time it takes to unload and load the products, Miguel realizes that adding more forklifts won’t significantly reduce the amount of time to get the products from the warehouse to downtown offices. Therefore, this is one cause of the problem, but it is not the root cause.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, Miguel has noticed that there is no set schedule for sending out deliveries. Since the problem only exists in the city instead of in the suburban areas, he realizes that traffic must also be playing a role in the late deliveries. Therefore, changing the schedule so that the delivery times are before the city’s rush hour may help fix the problem.       \n",
    "\n",
    "Pro tip: Fishbone diagrams are tools that can be useful during any phase of the project. When you use them in risk planning, you are trying to identify the possible causes of a problem that may or may not occur. When you use them in the execution phase, you are trying to find the root cause of an issue that has already occurred. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Key takeaway\n",
    "Identifying risks and measuring their potential impact on a project can be a complex task. You can help visualize these issues by creating fishbone diagrams. To recap, the steps to create a fishbone diagram are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Define the problem\n",
    "- Identify the categories\n",
    "- Brainstorm the causes\n",
    "- Analyze the causes\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you’ve developed a fishbone diagram to help find a problem’s root cause and measure its potential impact on the project, you can then move on to determining how to mitigate the risk. "

    "# Managing single point of failure risks\n",
    "Previously, you learned how to use various tools and strategies to identify and manage risks as you plan your project. In this reading, we will discuss how to manage risks with the highest potential of impacting your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Single point of failure risks\n",
    "Once you have identified your risks and ranked them, give special attention to the risks that could have a catastrophic effect on your team’s ability to complete the project. A single point of failure is a risk that, if it were to materialize, could cause a significant amount of disruption to your project and could even shut it down. You should plan for these risks early on in the project. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a lot of projects use subject matter experts (SMEs)—team members with a deep understanding of a particular job, process, department, function, technology, machine, material, or type of equipment. SMEs are involved to advise you throughout the project life cycle. Having only one SME familiar with a critical system on your team is an example of a single point of failure risk. This SME will only offer one perspective, and if they are the only person advising on the system, there is no one to offer another perspective. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Case study: Using mitigation strategies to manage single point of failure risks\n",
    "Let’s imagine that Office Green uses plant seeds from a company in South America for the majority of its offerings. The plants produced by these seeds are in high demand by Office Green’s customers. However, the local government on the suppliers’ end just announced that it would be imposing a new tax on the exporting of seeds and produce. As a result, the price of the seeds suddenly becomes so high that it is difficult for the company to supply the seeds to Office Green, putting the project at risk of not having these seeds available to purchase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s look at how these four risk mitigation strategies can be used for managing single point of failure risks in the Office Green example:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Avoid  \n",
    "This strategy seeks to sidestep—or avoid—the situation as a whole. In the Office Green example, the team could avoid this risk entirely by considering using another seed that is widely available in several locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Minimize  \n",
    "Mitigating a risk involves trying to minimize the catastrophic effects that it could have on the project. The key to minimizing risk starts with realizing that the risk exists. That is why you will usually hear mitigation strategies referred to as workarounds. What if the Office Green team decided to use both the original South American supplier and another supplier from a neighboring country? More than likely, the change in taxation and regulation wouldn’t affect both companies, and this would provide Office Green some flexibility without having to completely eliminate their preferred supplier.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Transfer \n",
    "The strategy of transferring shifts the responsibility of handling the risk to someone else. The Office Green team could find a supplier in North America that uses the seeds from several other South American countries and purchase the seeds from them instead. This transfers the ownership of South American regulatory risks and costs to that supplier.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Accept \n",
    "Lastly, you can accept the risk as the normal cost of doing business. Active acceptance of risk usually means setting aside extra funds to pay your way out of trouble. Passive acceptance of risk is the “do nothing” approach. While passive acceptance may be reasonable for smaller risks, it is not recommended for most single point of failure risks. It is also important to be proactive and mitigate risks ahead of time whenever possible, as this may save you from having to accept risks. In the Office Green scenario, the project manager could schedule a meeting with project stakeholders to discuss the increase in South American taxes and how it could impact the project cost. Then, they might decide to actively accept the risk by setting aside additional funds to source the seeds from another supplier, if necessary, or to passively accept the risk of not receiving the seeds at all this season.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key takeaway\n",
    "If you have strategies you can rely on for avoiding, minimizing, transferring, and accepting project risks—including single point of failure risks—you will be in a better position to protect your project from the possible impact of these risks.                               "

    "# Visualizing dependency relationships\n",
    "In the video, you learned to identify several types of risks. In this reading, we will be discussing the different types of dependencies that can play a critical role in our project’s success. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of dependencies  \n",
    "Dependencies are a relationship between two project tasks in which the completion or the initiation of one is reliant on the completion or initiation of the other. Let’s explore four common types of dependencies:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Finish to Start (FS)\n",
    "In this type of relationship between two tasks, Task A must be completed before Task B can start. This is the most common dependency in project management. It follows the natural progression from one task to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphic that lists Finish to Start Icon (A to B). Task B can't start until task A has finished\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: \n",
    "Imagine you are getting ready to have some friends over for dinner. You can’t start putting on your shoes (Task B) until you’ve finished putting on your socks (Task A). \n",
    "\n",
    "Task A: Finish putting on your socks. →Task B: Start putting on your shoes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Finish to Finish (FF)\n",
    "In this model, Task A must finish before Task B can finish. (This type of dependency is not common.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Earlier in the day, you baked a cake. You can’t finish decorating the cake (Task B) until you finish making the icing (Task A).\n",
    "\n",
    "Task A: Finish making the icing. →Task B: Finish decorating the cake.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Start to Start (SS)\n",
    "In this model, Task B can’t begin until Task A begins. This means Tasks A and B start at the same time and run in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:  You need to take the train home after work. You can’t get on the train (Task B) until you pay for the train ride (Task A).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Task A: Start by paying for your train ride. →Task B: Start going home by boarding the train.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Start to Finish (SF)\n",
    "In this model, Task A must begin before Task B can be completed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example:   One of your friends calls to tell you he’ll be late. He can’t finish his shift (Task B) and leave work until his coworker arrives to start her shift (Task A). \n",
    "\n",
    "Task A: Your friend’s coworker starts her shift. →Task B: Your friend finishes his shift.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dependency graphs\n",
    "As a project manager, you will use these dependencies to visually represent the flow of work during your project. Let’s examine how to use a dependency graph with an everyday example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you are making peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for the kids who will be coming to your dinner, and you want to use dependency relationships to map your activities on a graph.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Let’s break each task down to create your dependency graph:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When you start your sandwiches, you need to gather your materials: bread, knife, jelly, peanut butter, plates, and napkins (Task A). \n",
    "- At this point, you can put jelly on one piece of bread (Task B) and peanut butter on the other piece of bread (Task C).  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Key takeaways\n",
    "There are four types of task dependencies:\n",
    "\n",
    "Finish to Start\n",
    "\n",
    "Finish to Finish\n",
    "\n",
    "Start to Start\n",
