    "| **Project Manager's Role** | Project manager serves as an active leader by prioritizing and assigning tasks to team members. | Scrum Master acts primarily as a facilitator, removing any barriers the team faces. Team shares more responsibility in managing their own work. |\n",
    "| **Scope** | Project deliverables and plans are well-established and documented in the early stages of initiating and planning. Changes go through a formal change request process. | Planning happens in shorter iterations and focuses on delivering value quickly. Subsequent iterations are adjusted in response to feedback or unforeseen issues. |\n",
    "| **Schedule** | Follows a mostly linear path through the initiating, planning, executing, and closing phases of the project. | Time is organized into phases called Sprints. Each Sprint has a defined duration, with a set list of deliverables planned at the start of the Sprint. |\n",
    "| **Cost** | Costs are kept under control by careful estimation up front and close monitoring throughout the life cycle of the project. | Costs and schedule could change with each iteration. |\n",
    "| **Quality** | Project manager makes plans and clearly defines criteria to measure quality at the beginning of the project. | Team solicits ongoing stakeholder input and user feedback by testing products in the field and regularly implementing improvements. |\n",
    "| **Communication** | Project manager continually communicates progress toward milestones and other key indicators to stakeholders, ensuring that the project is on track to meet the customerâ€™s expectations. | Team is customer-focused, with consistent communication between users and the project team. |\n",
    "| **Stakeholders** | Project manager continually manages and monitors stakeholder engagement to ensure the project is on track. | Team frequently provides deliverables to stakeholders throughout the project. Progress toward milestone. |\n"
