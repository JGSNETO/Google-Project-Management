    "# Lean and Six Sigma methodologies\n",
    "Previously you learned about Agile and Waterfall project management approaches. Now, we will define some key concepts from Lean and Six Sigma methodologies. We will learn how these methodologies can be used to organize and manage your projects, and we will discuss which is the most effective for different kinds of projects.   \n",
    "\n",
    "## Lean\n",
    "Lean methodology is often referred to as Lean Manufacturing because it originated in the manufacturing world. The main principle in Lean methodology is the removal of waste within an operation. By optimizing process steps and eliminating waste, only value is added at each phase of production.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Today, the Lean Manufacturing methodology recognizes eight types of waste within an operation: defects, excess processing, overproduction, waiting, inventory, transportation, motion, and non-utilized talent. In the manufacturing industry, these types of waste are often attributed to issues such as: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Lack of proper documentation\n",
    "2. Lack of process standards\n",
    "3. Not understanding the customers’ needs\n",
    "4. Lack of effective communication\n",
    "5. Lack of process control\n",
    "6. Inefficient process design\n",
    "7. Failures of management\n",
    "\n",
    "These same issues create waste in project management. \n",
    "\n",
    "Implement Lean project management when you want to use limited resources, reduce waste, and streamline processes to gain maximum benefits. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can achieve this by using the pillars of the Lean 5S quality tool. The term 5S refers to the five pillars that are required for good housekeeping: sort, set in order, shine, standardize, and sustain. Implementing the 5S method means cleaning up and organizing the workplace to achieve the smallest amount of wasted time and material. The 5S method includes these five steps: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Sort: Remove all items not needed for current production operations and leave only the bare essentials. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Set in order: Arrange needed items so that they are easy to use. Label items so that anyone can find them or put them away. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Shine: Keep everything in the correct place. Clean your workspace every day.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Standardize: Perform the process in the same way every time. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Sustain: Make a habit of maintaining correct procedures and instill this discipline in your team.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the Lean methodology, 5S helps you boost performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "The final concept of Lean uses a Kanban scheduling system to manage production. The Kanban scheduling system, or Kanban board, is a visualization tool that enables you to optimize the flow of your team’s work. It gives the team a visual display to identify what needs to be done and when. The Kanban board uses cards that are moved from left to right to show progress and help your team coordinate the work. "

    "Kanban boards and 5S are core methods of the Lean methodology. They can help you successfully manage your project. Now let’s analyze the Six Sigma method and learn when is the best time to use it. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Six Sigma\n",
    "Six Sigma is a methodology used to reduce variations by ensuring that quality processes are followed every time. The term “Six Sigma” originates from statistics and generally means that items or processes should have 99.9996% quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "The seven key principles of Six Sigma are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Always focus on the customer.\n",
    "2. Identify and understand how the work gets done. Understand how work really happens.\n",
    "3. Make your processes flow smoothly.\n",
    "4. Reduce waste and concentrate on value.\n",
    "5. Stop defects by removing variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Involve and collaborate with your team.\n",
    "\n",
    "Approach improvement activity in a systematic way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use this methodology to find aspects of the product or process that are measurable like time, cost, or quantity. Then inspect that measurable item and reject any products that do not meet the Six Sigma standard. Any process that created unacceptable products has to be improved upon.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you understand both Lean and Six Sigma, let's see how they come together to improve the performance of your project!\n",
    "\n",
    "# Lean Six Sigma \n",
    "After both Lean and Six Sigma were put into practice, it was discovered that the two methodologies could be combined to increase benefits. The tools used in Lean, such as Kanban boards and 5S, build quality in processes from the beginning. Products developed using Lean methods are then inspected or tested using Six Sigma standards. The products that do not meet these standards are rejected. \n",
    "\n",
    "The largest difference between these methodologies is that Lean streamlines processes while Six Sigma reduces variation in products by building in quality from the beginning and inspecting products to ensure quality standards are met. You may find that one of these two methods—or using them both together—can improve the efficiency of your projects. "

    "# Common project management approaches and how to select one\n",
    "You have been learning a lot about different project management approaches and when to use them. In this reading, we will briefly recap some of the most common ones and recommend a couple of articles with supporting information. You’ll continue to learn more about these approaches throughout this certificate program. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Popular project management approaches\n",
    "Below is a brief recap of some of the project management approaches you’ve been introduced to so far:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Waterfall is a traditional methodology in which tasks and phases are completed in a linear, sequential manner, and each stage of the project must be completed before the next begins. The project manager is responsible for prioritizing and assigning tasks to team members. In Waterfall, the criteria used to measure quality is clearly defined at the beginning of the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Agile involves short phases of collaborative, iterative work with frequent testing and regularly-implemented improvements. Some phases and tasks happen at the same time as others. In Agile projects, teams share responsibility for managing their own work. Scrum and Kanban are examples of Agile frameworks, which are specific development approaches based on the Agile philosophy.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Scrum is an Agile framework that focuses on developing, delivering, and sustaining complex projects and products through collaboration, accountability, and an iterative process. Work is completed by small, cross-functional teams led by a Scrum Master and is divided into short Sprints with a set list of deliverables.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Kanban is a tool used in both Agile and Lean approaches that provides visual feedback about the status of the work in progress through the use of Kanban boards or charts. With Kanban, project managers use sticky notes or note cards on a physical or digital Kanban board to represent the team’s tasks with categories like “To do,” “In progress,” and “Done.”\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Lean uses the 5S quality tool to eliminate eight areas of waste, save money, improve quality, and streamline processes. Lean’s principles state that you can do more with less by addressing dysfunctions that create waste. Lean implements a Kanban scheduling system to manage production.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Six Sigma involves reducing variations by ensuring that quality processes are followed every time. The Six Sigma method follows a process-improvement approach called DMAIC, which stands for define, measure, analyze, improve, and control.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Lean Six Sigma is a combination of Lean and Six Sigma approaches. It is often used in projects that aim to save money, improve quality, and move through processes quickly. Lean Six Sigma is also ideal for solving complex or high-risk problems. The 5S organization framework, the DMAIC process, and the use of Kanban boards are all components of this approach. \n",
    "\n",
    "Despite their differences, all of these project management methodologies require communication and collaboration among various teams and aim to deliver projects on time and within budget. "
